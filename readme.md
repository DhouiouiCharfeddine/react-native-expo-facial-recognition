Why this project exists
This repository helps developers build a mobile facial recognition system that runs on both Android and iOS using Expo. It provides a complete stack: registration, user verification, and persistent storage, all powered by ArcFace ONNX for accurate identity matching. The app focuses on clear user flows and robust handling of real-world conditions, such as varying lighting, angles, and expression.

Key features
- On-device face detection and landmark extraction for responsive UX.
- ArcFace ONNX integration for high-accuracy face embeddings.
- Registration flow: capture and store a user’s face data with metadata.
- Verification flow: compare live captures to stored embeddings with confidence scores.
- Persistent storage: local databases and optional cloud sync for backup.

How ArcFace ONNX fits in
ArcFace provides a robust embedding space for faces. ONNX makes it possible to run the model efficiently on devices that support neural processing units or accelerated CPU. The setup in this project uses an ONNX runtime compatible with React Native through a bridge or a native module, enabling rapid, on-device inference. The model outputs a fixed-length feature vector that is used to compute cosine similarity against stored embeddings. This approach minimizes network latency and enhances privacy.

Registration workflow
- User opens the Registration screen.
- The app requests camera permission and guides the user to position their face in the frame.
- The system detects a face, identifies landmarks, and extracts the ArcFace embedding.
- You can optionally capture multiple images to create a robust embedding, which helps with variations in pose and lighting.
- Metadata is collected: user name, ID, and optionally tags such as department or role.
- The embedding is stored locally with a unique user identifier and a timestamp. If you enable cloud sync, the data is encrypted before transmission.
- A seed or salting strategy can be applied to embeddings for added security, while keeping the ability to compare embeddings easily.

Verification workflow
- The user lands on the verification screen.
- The app captures a live frame, runs face detection, and extracts an embedding.
- The embedding is compared to stored embeddings using a similarity score.
- If the score passes a predefined threshold, the app authenticates the user and proceeds to the requested action.
- The interface provides clear feedback: success, failure, or a retry prompt with guidance.

Persistent storage design
- Local storage:
  - Embeddings are stored in a local database with a compact schema.
  - Data is encrypted at rest using a symmetric key derived from a user passphrase or device-level secure storage.
  - Each embedding is linked to a user profile with metadata.
- Cloud sync (optional):
  - When enabled, data can be synced to a backend with end-to-end encryption in transit.
  - Conflict resolution handles out-of-sync scenarios gracefully.
- Backups:
  - Regular backups can be created to restore data in case of device loss or app reinstall.

On-device inference details
- The ArcFace ONNX model runs locally on the device where possible, avoiding network latency.
- The app uses a lightweight detector to identify faces and landmarks quickly.
- Embeddings are produced in real time and compared with a simple cosine similarity metric.
- Performance optimizations focus on avoiding unnecessary frames, reducing memory usage, and leveraging hardware acceleration when available.
- The system gracefully handles frames without faces or with non-frontal faces by skipping processing and prompting the user to adjust.

Security and privacy considerations
- Biometric data is stored on-device by default, with optional cloud backup encrypted end-to-end.
- No raw camera frames are uploaded unless the user opts in to cloud backup.
- Embeddings are not reversible to the original image, but they still require careful handling.
- A strong emphasis on least privilege: the app requests only necessary permissions and loses access when idle or on user logout.
- Clear user consent prompts for registration, verification, and data storage actions.

Architecture overview
- Presentation layer:
  - React Native components provide a responsive UI for registration, verification, and settings.
  - The camera feed is displayed in a dedicated view with overlays for landmarks.
- Business logic:
  - Registration and verification modules manage the flow, including error handling and retries.
  - A service layer handles storage, encryption, and communications with optional cloud backends.
- Data layer:
  - Local database stores user profiles and embeddings.
  - A model cache stores the ONNX model to minimize load times.
- Model and inference layer:
  - ONNX model runs via a runtime that supports the target platform.
  - A detector identifies faces and landmarks; embeddings are computed and compared.

Extending and customizing
- Adding new models:
  - Swap the ONNX model with a different one, ensuring input dimensions and output shapes align with existing logic.
  - Update normalization steps to match the new model’s training regime.
- Tweaking thresholds:
  - The similarity threshold for verification is adjustable to trade off false positives and false negatives.
  - You can implement a per-user threshold profile if your use case demands fine-grained control.
- Custom metadata:
  - Extend the user profile schema with custom fields (department, role, access level).
  - Your cloud backend can enforce access controls based on these fields.
- UI customization:
  - Replace our default styles with your brand’s colors while preserving accessibility and readability.
  - Add localization strings to support new languages.

Testing and quality checks
- Unit tests:
  - Validate embedding extraction against a known test set.
  - Test the storage layer with sample profiles and encrypted data.
- Integration tests:
  - Test the end-to-end registration and verification flows in a controlled environment.
  - Ensure cloud sync, if enabled, handles conflicts and retries gracefully.
- Performance testing:
  - Measure inference time per frame on target devices.
  - Profile memory usage and battery impact during continuous operation.
- Accessibility tests:
  - Ensure color contrast is adequate for landmarks overlays.
  - Provide screen reader labels for all interactive elements.

Debugging and troubleshooting
- Common issues:
  - Permission denied for camera or storage: ensure runtime permissions are granted by the OS prompts.
  - Model not loading: verify model path and cache; clear app data if needed.
  - Slow verification: check device performance and reduce frame processing rate or adjust thresholds.
- Logs and diagnostics:
  - Enable verbose logging in development mode to capture inference timings and data flow.
  - Use a remote logging endpoint if you deploy to a backend for monitoring.

Offline and resilience
- The app prioritizes on-device computation to stay usable offline.
- If the cloud is unavailable, registration and verification proceed using local data.
- When connectivity returns, you can opt to push data to the cloud or sync pending changes.

Platform notes
- Android:
  - The APK for testing is provided in the releases page. Install by enabling unknown sources in the device settings.
  - Verify that hardware acceleration for neural networks is enabled in the device’s settings or via the app configuration.
- iOS:
