### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are welcome! Include:

- **Clear title and description**
- **Use case and motivation**
- **Proposed implementation** (if you have ideas)
- **Potential impact** on existing functionality

### Pull Requests

1. **Fork the repo** and create your branch from `main`
2. **Make your changes** following our coding standards
3. **Add tests** if you've added code that should be tested
4. **Update documentation** if you've changed APIs
5. **Ensure tests pass** and code follows style guidelines
6. **Create a pull request** with a clear title and description

#### Pull Request Guidelines

- **One feature per PR** - keep changes focused
- **Clear commit messages** - use conventional commits format
- **Update documentation** - keep README.md and comments current
- **Add tests** - maintain or improve test coverage
- **Follow code style** - use ESLint and Prettier

## üèóÔ∏è Development Guidelines

### Code Style

We use ESLint and Prettier for consistent code formatting:

```bash
# Run linting
npm run lint

# Fix auto-fixable issues
npm run lint -- --fix

# Type checking
npm run type-check
```

### Commit Message Format

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```
feat(face-detection): add confidence threshold configuration
fix(storage): resolve AsyncStorage race condition
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

## üéØ Areas for Contribution

### High Priority

- **Performance optimizations** - face detection and model inference
- **Additional AI models** - support for other face recognition models
- **Testing** - improve test coverage
- **Documentation** - API documentation and tutorials
- **Accessibility** - screen reader support and accessibility features

### Medium Priority

- **Face database management** - import/export functionality
- **Batch operations** - register multiple faces at once
- **Advanced settings** - configurable thresholds and parameters
- **Analytics** - usage statistics and performance metrics

### Good First Issues

- **UI improvements** - animations and visual enhancements
- **Error messages** - better user feedback
- **Code cleanup** - refactoring and optimization
- **Documentation** - README improvements and code comments

## üîß Technical Considerations

### Face Recognition

- Understand ArcFace model requirements (112x112 input, CHW format)
- Consider privacy implications of biometric data
- Test on multiple devices and lighting conditions
- Optimize for mobile performance constraints

### React Native

- Follow React Native best practices
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Consider iOS and Android platform differences

### Performance

- Profile memory usage during face processing
- Optimize tensor operations and cleanup
- Consider background processing for heavy operations
- Test on lower-end devices

## üìã Review Process

1. **Automated checks** must pass (linting, type checking, tests)
2. **Manual review** by maintainers
3. **Testing** on different devices/platforms
4. **Documentation** review if applicable
5. **Merge** after approval

### Review Criteria

- Code quality and readability
- Test coverage and quality
- Performance impact
- Security considerations
- Breaking change assessment
- Documentation completeness
